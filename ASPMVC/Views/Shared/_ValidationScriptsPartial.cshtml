@*query.validate.min.js: This library is a part of the jQuery Validation Plugin.
    It provides functionality for defining validation rules and messages for form fields.
    When included in a web page, it allows you to specify validation rules in your HTML form elements using
    data attributes, and it automatically performs client-side validation based on those rules. For example,
    you can specify that a field is required, must be a valid email, or must meet custom validation criteria.
jquery.validate.unobtrusive.min.js: This library is specifically designed to work with ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET
    Core applications. It enhances the functionality of jquery.validate.min.js by integrating with
    ASP.NET Core's model validation. It reads validation attributes applied to model properties in C# code
    (such as [Required], [MaxLength], etc.) and generates corresponding validation rules on the client side.
    This allows for consistent client-side and server-side validation logic.*@
