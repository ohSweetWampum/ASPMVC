@*This code checks if there is a "success" message stored in the TempData dictionary.
    If such a message exists, it includes the jQuery and Toastr library scripts and then displays a
    success notification using Toastr. The message is retrieved from TempData["success"].*@


@if (TempData["success"] != null)
{
    <script src="~/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/toastr.js/latest/js/toastr.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        toastr.success('@TempData["success"]');
    </script>
}
@if (TempData["error"] != null)
{
    <script src="~/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/toastr.js/latest/js/toastr.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        toastr.error('@TempData["success"]');
    </script>
}


@*Toastr is a JavaScript library for displaying non-blocking notifications or toast messages to the user.
    It provides a visually appealing way to show success, warning, error, or informational messages on a
    web page.*@




@*TempData is a feature in ASP.NET Core that allows you to store data temporarily and pass it from one action
        method to another, typically during an HTTP redirect. It is often used for scenarios where you need to
        display a message or data to the user on the next page after a redirect. Here are some key characteristics
        of TempData:

    Temporary Storage: TempData is designed to store data temporarily between two successive requests.
        It's useful when you need to persist data from the first request (e.g., a form submission) and access
        it in the subsequent request (e.g., after a redirect).*@


@*In summary, _Notification.cshtml is used to display client-side notifications to users based on messages
    stored in TempData. If there are "success" or "error" messages in TempData, it includes the necessary
    JavaScript libraries and uses Toastr to show these messages as notifications to the user.*@
