@*Layout Specification: In ViewStart.cshtml, you can specify a common layout (usually a shared layout template)
    that should be used as the default layout for all views in the folder where ViewStart.cshtml resides.
    In your example, Layout = "_Layout"; sets the default layout for views in the same folder.*@
