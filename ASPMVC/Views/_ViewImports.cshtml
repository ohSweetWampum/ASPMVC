@*//Namespace Imports: In ViewImports.cshtml, you specify namespaces that should be imported and made
    available to all Razor views in the application. This means that you don't have to add @using directives
    for these namespaces in every individual view file.
Tag Helpers Import: It also includes a line for importing Tag Helpers. Tag Helpers are a feature in
    ASP.NET Core that enable server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements.
    By including @addTagHelper, you make Tag Helpers available for use in all views.*@
